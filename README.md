=WSUSpect Proxy=

This is a proof of concept script to inject 'fake' updates into non-SSL WSUS traffic.
It is based on our BlackHat USA 2015 presentation, 'WSUSpect â€“ Compromising the Windows Enterprise via Windows Update'

White paper: http://www.contextis.com/documents/161/CTX_WSUSpect_White_Paper.pdf
Slides: TODO

==Prerequisites==
You'll need the Python Twisted library installed. You can do this by running:
 pip install twisted

You also need to place an MS-signed binary (e.g. PsExec) into the payloads directory. 
This script has been tested on Python 2.7 on Linux. It does not yet work with Python 3.x; contributions are welcome.
 
==Usage==
To test this out, you'll need a target Windows 7 or 8 machine that is configured to receive updates 
from a WSUS server over unencrypted HTTP. The machine should be configured to proxy through the 
machine running this script. This can be done by manually changing the proxy settings or via other
means such as WPAD poisoning (e.g. using Responder)

 python wsuspect_proxy.py payload_name [port]

An example payload for PsExec is set up that will launch cmd.exe running as Administrator:

 python wsuspect_proxy.py psexec

==Customisation==

Modify payloads/payloads.ini to change the payloads and their arguments.
